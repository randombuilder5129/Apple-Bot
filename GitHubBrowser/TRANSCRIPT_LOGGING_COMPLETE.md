# Transcript Logging System - Complete Implementation

## Features Added

### Automatic Moderation Log Integration
- Ticket transcripts are now automatically sent to moderation log channels
- Transcripts are generated when tickets are closed or deleted
- Manual transcript generation also sends to log channel

### Log Channel Detection
The system looks for log channels in this order:
1. **Common channel names**: mod-logs, modlogs, logs, moderation-logs, ticket-logs
2. **Database lookup**: Uses stored log_channel setting from guild_settings table
3. **Fallback**: If no log channel found, transcripts are only sent to user

### Transcript Content
Each logged transcript includes:
- Complete conversation history with timestamps
- Embed and attachment notifications
- Channel information and action type (closed/deleted)
- Message count and generation timestamp

### Log Message Format
- Professional embed with ticket information
- Attached transcript file with formatted content
- Channel, category, and message count details
- Automatic timestamp for audit trails

### Integration Points
- **Manual Transcript**: User gets ephemeral copy + log channel gets permanent copy
- **Ticket Closure**: Automatic transcript generation before channel changes
- **Ticket Deletion**: Automatic transcript generation before channel removal

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if log channel unavailable
- Error logging for troubleshooting
- Continues operation even if logging fails

The system is now fully operational and will automatically preserve ticket conversations in your moderation log channels.
