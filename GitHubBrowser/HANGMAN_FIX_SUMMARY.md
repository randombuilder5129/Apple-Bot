# Hangman Game Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the hangman game where typing letters wasn't being acknowledged or processed by the bot.

## Root Cause
The `on_message` event handler was calling `self.display_hangman(message)` incorrectly, passing a message object instead of a proper context object that the display function expected.

## Technical Fix

### Problem
```python
# Incorrect - passing message object to function expecting context
await self.display_hangman(message)
```

### Solution
```python
# Correct - calling dedicated message handler
await self.display_hangman_message(message.channel, message.author)
```

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Message Handler
- Created `display_hangman_message()` method specifically for message events
- Properly handles channel and author parameters
- Maintains all game logic and visual display features
- Awards economy rewards correctly when players win

### Game Flow Fix
1. User types `!hangman` to start game
2. Bot displays initial hangman state with word blanks
3. User types single letters (a-z) 
4. Bot processes letter guess and updates game state
5. Bot displays updated hangman with guessed letters
6. Game continues until win/lose condition met

### Features Working
- Letter validation (single alphabetic characters only)
- Duplicate guess detection with warning messages
- Progressive hangman drawing with 6 stages
- Win/lose condition checking
- Economy integration with coin rewards
- Game state cleanup on completion

## Game Commands

### Start Game
```
!hangman
```
- Starts new hangman game in current channel
- Prevents multiple games in same channel
- Shows initial game state with blanks

### Make Guesses
```
a    # Type any single letter
b    # Each letter updates the game
z    # Wrong letters add to hangman drawing
```

### Game Features
- **Word Display**: Shows guessed letters and blanks
- **Wrong Guess Counter**: Tracks mistakes (max 6)
- **Guessed Letters**: Shows all previously guessed letters
- **Progressive Drawing**: Visual hangman gets more complete
- **Win Condition**: Guess all letters before hangman complete
- **Lose Condition**: Make 6 wrong guesses

## Testing Verified
- Letter input recognition working
- Game state updates properly 
- Visual hangman progression correct
- Win/lose detection functional
- Economy rewards distributed correctly
- Multiple game prevention working

The hangman game now fully responds to letter inputs and provides an engaging word-guessing experience.
